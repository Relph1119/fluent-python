    Metaclass for new and improved "Bunch": implicitly defines
    __slots__, __init__ and __repr__ from variables bound in
    class scope.
    A class statement for an instance of MetaBunch (i.e., for a
    class whose metaclass is MetaBunch) must define only
    class-scope data attributes (and possibly special methods, but
    NOT __init__ and __repr__).  MetaBunch removes the data
    attributes from class scope, snuggles them instead as items in
    a class-scope dict named __dflts__, and puts in the class a
    __slots__ with those attributes' names, an __init__ that takes
    as optional named arguments each of them (using the values in
    __dflts__ as defaults for missing ones), and a __repr__ that
    shows the repr of each attribute that differs from its default
    value (the output of __repr__ can be passed to __eval__ to make
    an equal instance, as per usual convention in the matter, if
    each non-default-valued attribute respects the convention too).

    In v3, the order of data attributes remains the same as in the
    class body; in v2, there is no such guarantee.
